# spaceranger
The first Scratch game I've ever coded and my contribution to the Week 0 problem set for the CS50 course. Space Ranger is a shoot 'em up inspired by the likes of Galaga, R-Type and Parodius. Take on hordes of alien scum and save the galaxy!  There are two full levels including end bosses.
